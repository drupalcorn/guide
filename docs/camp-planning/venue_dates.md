## Choosing Dates
Setting the dates and choosing the venue are items that are dependant on each other. If a venue isn't available we can't have a camp. In order to secure good rates for hotels and to attract as many local people as possible, we try to avoid having the camp during major events in central Iowa.

Examples of events to avoid:

* Other Drupal Camps or Cons
* The Iowa State Fair
* RAGBRAI
* Iowa v Iowa State Football Game
* First day of school
* Other Iowa or Iowa State football games (depending on status of opponent)
* Check local event calendars for any other high-profile events.

## Rooms and Spaces
Our need for rooms and spaces will vary from day to day.

**Training Day**

* Committee room
* Up to 3 rooms for separate trainings

**Session Days**

* Committee Room 
* ~3 Session Rooms
* Space for Keynote. Can be in common area, a large session room, or a separate room.
* Space for BoFs. Can be in common area or a couple classrooms.
* Space for Sponsors. Can be in common area or in hallway. Try for high traffic areas.
* ~1 Meeting room 
* Optional space for Friday Party

**Contribution Day**

* Committee Room
* 1 sprint room

## WiFi
This is important. Know what the options are for connecting to WiFi. Log on to all the options and run speed tests. Ask them how other groups have found the WiFi to preform. Have other tech conferences used the venue before? How did that work out for them? Are there any port blocks or data caps. Eg. SSH or IRC blocked? Data limit of only 1 or 2 GB? What tech support do they have in case there are problems?

## Other considerations
* Do they allow outside catering?
* What's the deposit?
* Discount for not for profit?
* Who else may be using the facility at the same time?
* Registration area?
* Building and room access?
* Who to contact about facilities during event?
* Parking and transportation
* Signage policies (tape on walls, easels, etc?)
