Sponsors are what make an event possible. Bringing value to and treating our sponsors well helps grow our events over the years.

## What is the value of the event to a sponsor?

While it is commendable to sponsor an event just because it "supports the community", there is value that is expected by a sponsor. It is important that we communicate how their funding will be be used and how they will be recognized for their contribution. Here are a few bullets of value sponsors are looking for:

* They want to be known for contributing to the success of the community
* They want to have the opportunity to meet and sell their product with the people that come to the event.
* They want to show that they are a talented, trustworthy, and competent organization.

Every sponsor is different, and may have different values and goals they may be trying to accomplish when sponsoring an event. It is important to do research on the sponsor to understand what their goals are, and why they may be interested in sponsoring. When engaging with a sponsor, it doesn't hurt to ask what their values and goals may be. Maybe we can work something out, maybe not, but it should be asked.  How are there ways the event can help meet their goals and communicate their message to the right audience?

Look at other events potential sponsors have sponsored in the past and what sort of sponsorships were offered and how it was handled. If you can, talk with other organizers about what they do for their sponsors.

## Sponsorship Prospectus and Packages

People are busy. The same is true of people at organizations that would like to help. So, to make the decision-making easier for sponsors, we can provide a menu of ways a sponsor may want to support the event. We can do this by providing a sponsorship prospectus for Sponsorship Opportunities. This should be one of the first pages up on the website as soon as we have the dates and venue locked in.

The prospectus must be easy to read and understood quickly. It will need information about how the funds will be used, what benefits are available, how much they cost, and how they can get a hold of you to purchase a sponsorship. Look around at other similar event prospectuses and have conversations with other event organizers to get some ideas on what we can offer. Generally a prospectus will lay out:

* **General information** about the event. This is dates, times, locations, number of attendees expected and their demographics, and activities (sessions, training, contribution day, social events, lunch, scholarships, etc.)
* **Contact information** for how to ask questions and move forward with a sponsorship. Give the name of a person and an email address, preferably @drupalcorn.org. Cultivating a personal relationship with the people who manage sponsorships for an organization is really important.
* **Sponsorship Levels** shown in an easy to read comparison table. Pricing for these levels depends on expected costs and what sponsors are willing to pay and will often change from year to year based on performance. Some of the benefits may be limited (such as number of rooms to name, or number a tables that can fit in the venue. Being in Iowa, our location tends to have some of the more affordable options compared to other camps. An example comparison table from 2019:

|                   | Platinum<br>$1500 | Gold<br>$750 | Silver<br>$300 |
|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Named Room        | X                 |              |                |
| Table             | X                 | X            |                |
| Listed on Website | X                 | X            | X              |
| Attendee tickets  | 6                 | 4            | 2              |

* **Additional Sponsorship Opportunities**. List any other Ã  la carte sponsorship opportunities. These can be sold as stand-alone or as an add-on to any of the sponsorship levels. Items we've done in the past are
	* Badge - Adding logo to attendee badges
	* Contribution Day - Pay for contribution day to happen. Food, venue, costs
	* Social - Pay for and maybe organize an evening social for the event
	* In-Kind - Offer to provide swag items (ads, pens, keychains, etc), subscriptions or extended trials or software licenses for attendees.
