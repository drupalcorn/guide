## Timeline

Camp planning timelines are pretty flexible. However, to be successful, having a plan for when certain things need to be done will save a lot of last-minute scrambles to get things done. Below is a proposed timeline in weeks.

### Pre-Planning
The first thing to happen is the Core Committee decides on a city to host and selects a lead for the camp committee. Usually the camp committee lead is a member of the Core Committee or someone the Core Committee would like to see join the Core Committee.
