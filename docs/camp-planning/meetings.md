## Meetings

Meetings for camp are usually fairly informal. They take place online via whatever video conference technology is adopted by the committee. Usually zoom.us or Google Hangouts.

Frequency and timing of the meetings is defined by the committee. Usually this ends up being noon to 1pm. At the start of planning, meetings are usually every other week; but as camp gets closer and things are starting to come together faster, it may end up happening once a week or a few times a week immediately before the start of camp.

Notes are taken collaboratively in a Google Doc in the Google Drive. Each meeting will have its own doc and is usually found in a meetings folder. Suggested naming scheme to keep the documents in chronological order alphabetically is `Meeting-Y-m-d`. Eg: `Meeting-2018-01-01`.

Agendas may be defined collaboratively before the meeting in the Google doc as required.
