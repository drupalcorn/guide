## Overview
The website is the primary source of information about the camp. All other mentions of the camp on other websites, social media, emails, stickers, and other marketing materials will reference the camp website for the canonical source of information about DrupalCorn.

It is important that the website is updated as soon as information is available and reflects the DrupalCorn [Identity and Brand](../../identity). 

## Registration
Registration is usually done through Eventbrite. Eventbrite offers an embeddable widget that can be placed on a registration page. Actually integrating Eventbrite with the Drupal site can be difficult, so that's optional. Any call-to-action for registration (such as in the a news item, or a page listing trainings) should link to the registration page that the embed widget is displayed.

## Basic Pages
There are a few generic pages that we normally have on the site.

* **About** - General information about DrupalCorn. [Example](http://2018.drupalcorn.org/about/index.html)
* **Location(s)** - A list of all the venues for the camp. Address, maps, and pictures of all the places. A list of transportation options in the area (public transit, taxi, shuttles, airport information). [Example](http://2018.drupalcorn.org/venue/index.html)
* **Lodging** - Information about the hotel blocks reserved for DrupalCorn along with address, deadlines, parking, WiFi and other basic information. Pictures would be nice too. [Example](http://2018.drupalcorn.org/lodging/index.html)
* **Policies/CoC** - Review the policies every year. Considering we have this handbook, it may be good to link to the handbook pages about our policies. The Code of Conduct also usually lives here. A link to this page should also be on every page of the site. [Example](http://2018.drupalcorn.org/policies/index.html)
* **Sponsor Opportunities** - Information for potential sponsors. Explain the demographics of DrupalCorn and describe what sponsor levels or opportunities we offer. This page is important to get published as soon as possible. [Example](http://2018.drupalcorn.org/sponsor/index.html).

## Sponsors
A content type for sponsors so that we can display our sponsorships across the site. Usual fields are the following:

* **Name** - Could be the title field. The name of the sponsor
* **Type** - Term reference for what type of sponsor they are, eg: Gold, Silver, Platinum, Badge, Party, Sprint, In-Kind, etc.
* **URL** - The URL the sponsor would like us to send people to.
* **Description** - Could be the body field. About a paragraph about the the sponsor and what they do. Call-to-action, if any.
* **Logo** - Image field to hold a high resolution jpg or png of the sponsor's logo.
* **People** - If we're ambitious, we could relate users/presenters with sponsors so that their sessions can be featured on their sponsor page.

Sponsors are usually listed on a sponsor listing page with just their logo linked to the node, grouped by Type. [Example](http://2018.drupalcorn.org/sponsors/index.html). Platinum sponsors can also be displayed in a block that is displayed on all pages of the site.

## Schedule
## Sessions
## Users
## Teaser/Splash Site
In order to get information out as early as possible and to help recruit sponsors, we sometimes publish a static site with basic information about dates, venue, and information about sponsoring.
