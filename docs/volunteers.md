- It is important to monitor the webform submissions to know if you have people interested in helping.

## Tracking Who Is Doing What
Using a spreadsheet (Google Sheet or Excel), create a spreadsheet for each day. If the spreadsheet is in Google Sheets, the link can be shared so volunteers can go to the sheet and sign up for time slots. We use "v-" in the spreadsheet to indicate where volunteers could sign up/were needed.

 - Label each sheet with the specific date. 
 - Create a timeline in column A, increment in 15 minute blocks.
	The spaces are used to fill in volunteer names.
 - Column B is the list of general events
	(i.e. - Registration, Keynote, AM Snack, Sessions)
	 Include all areas where people need to set up items, meet other people like the caterer or presenters etc.
 - The following columns are used to list the session rooms and the topics of the session. These are listed at the appropriate times with space for volunteers to sign up to help with the sessions.
