# The Beginning
![Old DrupalCorn Logo](../img/drupalcornguy.png)

Before there was a Drupal camp in Iowa, there was a group called DrupalCorn that had monthly meetups in Ames. The group was started in 2006 by [Matt Westgate](https://www.drupal.org/user/2275). It seems he may have [coined the word "DrupalCorn"](https://groups.drupal.org/node/1814). A few years later the group was mostly organized by [Michael Hofmockel](https://www.drupal.org/user/20694).

 Now, it's called the [Central Iowa Drupal Users Group](https://groups.drupal.org/iowa) (CIDUG). The name was changed in order to help alleviate any confusion between the camp, which is organized by people from across the state, and the local meetup.

## 2012 - Ames
http://2012.drupalcorn.org
August 2-4, 2012

This was the first time we had multiple days. The original plan was to just have 2 days of sessions, but when we got our keynote speaker we added a day of training. The event was held at the Scheman building on the Iowa State University camps. The venue was fairly expensive and catering was limited to their on-site option, which cost more money. Fiscal sponsorship was provided by the Brenton Center at Iowa State University.
