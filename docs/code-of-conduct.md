# Code of Conduct
All attendees, including but not limited to, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## The Quick Version

Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.

## How to Make a Report

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.

**If it is an emergency, contact the police by dialing 911.**

### How to get assistance:

All reports will be handled confidentiality. If you agree, we will contact you and arrange to speak privately. You are welcome to bring a trusted person for support. We will clarify any policies, and discuss what options are available for addressing the complaint. The alleged transgressor will be notified of the complaint and asked for any other information. Staff will confer to decide on appropriate action. If the complaint is determined to violate the code of conduct, weâ€™ll let you know how we plan to proceed. This procedure may be adjusted to accommodate unique circumstances.
