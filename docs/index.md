# About this Guide
This guide is meant as a guide to help the committee plan a camp. It serves as documentation for what has been done in the past, offers some 'default' decisions and, hopefully, provides a little advice. It is also meant as a resource to help on-board new people interested in helping put on DrupalCorn.

The contents of this guide should be taken as recommendations based on what has worked for us in the past. If new ideas come up and sound reasonable to the planning committee, by all means explore it and implement it. If it works out well, modify this guide. This is **not** meant to strike down good ideas or to be the end-all for any disagreements.

## Contributing to the Guide
This guide is created using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/), a documentation tool that uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It is hosted on DrupalCorn's GitHub. Feel free to fork, create issues, and make pull requests. If you fork it for your own camp, please [let us know](mailto:info@drupalcorn.org), we're interested in hearing how it's being used.
