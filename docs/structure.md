# The James Gang

[The James Gang](http://www.jamesgangic.com/) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit community-building organization based in Iowa City. You may see DrupalCorn referred to as "The James Gang d.b.a. DrupalCorn Camp".  The "d.b.a." part means "doing business as". This allows us to accept checks under the name "DrupalCorn Camp". 

The James Gang provides DrupalCorn with the following:

- A tax identification number and W9
- Nonprofit status
- Accounting services for taxes
- Business insurance
- A network of other nonprofits in Iowa
- A bank account with debit credit card

In return, DrupalCorn provides the following to The James Gang:

- Annual dues for operating overhead, usually only a couple hundred dollars a year
- Be part of the nextwork of other nonprofits in Iowa
- Must serve on The James Gang board and attend monthly meetings

# Camp Committee

The camp committee is responsible for the planning and execution of a camp. Every year the core committee will determine the starting members of the camp committee. The committee can have as many members as needed and is self-organizing.

The camp committee must include at least one member of the core committee. Usually there will be more than one member from core, or the entire camp committee may be members of the core committee.
