# Overview

DrupalCorn has a reputation for being a well-branded event. This has been accomplished by having a good handle on how we present ourselves in our marketing and communications. Overall some words that might describe the DrupalCorn brand may be:

 - Friendly / Welcoming
 - Corny / Silly / Goofy
 - Organized
 - Thoughtful
 - Sharing
 - Community
 
Thinking about these positive connotations and communicating them in our marketing and brand help make DrupalCorn stand out.

Below are some guidelines for how we use our branding.

# Decision Making

We should strive to be friendly and welcoming to *everyone* in our communications and event planning. Some common things to keep in mind are, but not limited to:

- Is this welcoming for people new to Drupal?
- Alcohol consumption should not be heavily promoted
- - Offer an interesting variety of non-alcoholic options if alcohol is to be served and communicate the availability.
- Could this easily lead to a situation where someone may go too far and violate the Code of Conduct?
- Would this limit the ability for some people (especially underrepresented people) to be able to participate?

# Druplicorn Logo

The Druplicorn logo is one of the most identifiable logos for Drupal camps around. It is a kernel of corn with the Druplicon face on it. It is friendly, bright, and colorful.
