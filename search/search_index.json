Now, it's called the Central Iowa Drupal Users Group (CIDUG).

To make things easier for people we usually reserve a block of rooms at 1 or 2 hotels near the venue. Terms of block reservations vary between hotels, so it's important to know what those terms are. Information the hotels would like to know # How many rooms on what days? For the traditional format of a 4-day conference our bloks looks like the following: Wednesday - Thursday (Training) - Friday (session) - Saturday (session) - Sunday (contrib day) - Other Information What DrupalCorn is. Mention our 501(c)(3) status and that we've been doing this since 2012. Where the venue is. Perhaps they have a shuttle or ideas how to get people to to and from the event. Let them know our guests will likely want to use internet access in their rooms Any other rooms we may want. Eg. A small conference room to have a game night. Questions for the hotels # Is there a cost to us to reserve rooms? It is important to know if the hotel is going to charge for the block or if certain minimums are not met the hotel may charge. Usually it's best to be able to avoid paying for the block. Can we add extra perks for our guests? Some things to consider could be be upgrading to premium Wi-Fi, free breakfast, or a free drink. Sometimes there's a charge, sometimes they are willing to give them at no cost. Make sure they know you are shopping. How is the Wi-Fi? Having good Wi-Fi is essential to our attendees.

Bringing value to and treating our sponsors well helps grow our events over the years. What is the value of the event to a sponsor? # While it is commendable to sponsor an event just because it \"supports the community\", there is value that is expected by a sponsor. It is important that we communicate how their funding will be be used and how they will be recognized for their contribution. Here are a few bullets of value sponsors are looking for: They want to be known for contributing to the success of the community They want to have the opportunity to meet and sell their product with the people that come to the event. They want to show that they are a talented, trustworthy, and competent organization. They want to recruit talent to work for them Every sponsor is different, and may have different values and goals they may be trying to accomplish when sponsoring an event. It is important to do research on the sponsor to understand what their goals are, and why they may be interested in sponsoring. When engaging with a sponsor, it doesn't hurt to ask what their values and goals may be. Maybe we can work something out, maybe not, but it should be asked. How are there ways the event can help meet their goals and communicate their message to the right audience? Look at other events potential sponsors have sponsored in the past and what sort of sponsorships were offered and how it was handled. If you can, talk with other organizers about what they do for their sponsors. Sponsorship Prospectus and Packages # People are busy. So, to make the decision-making easier for sponsors, we can provide a menu of ways a sponsor may want to support the event. We can do this by putting together a prospectus of Sponsorship Opportunities. This should be one of the first pages up on the website as soon as we have the dates and venue locked in. Ideally, this should done and ready to go before DrupalCon, especially if any organizers will be attending. The prospectus must be easy to read and understood quickly. It will need information about how the funds will be used, what benefits are available, how much they cost, and how they can get a hold of you to purchase a sponsorship. Look around at other similar event prospectuses and have conversations with other event organizers to get some ideas on what we can offer. Generally a prospectus will lay out: General information about the event. This is dates, times, locations, number of attendees expected and their demographics, and activities (sessions, training, contribution day, social events, lunch, scholarships, etc.) Contact information for how to ask questions and move forward with a sponsorship. Give the name of a specific person and an email address, preferably @drupalcorn.org. Cultivating a personal relationship with the people who manage sponsorships for an organization is really important. Sponsorship Levels shown in an easy to read comparison table. Pricing for these levels depends on expected costs and what sponsors are willing to pay and will often change from year to year based on performance. Being in Iowa, our location tends to have some of the more affordable options compared to other camps. An example comparison table from 2019: Platinum $1500 Gold $750 Silver $300 Named Room X Table X X Listed on Website X X X Attendee tickets 6 4 2 Additional Sponsorship Opportunities . List any other \u00e0 la carte sponsorship opportunities. These can be sold as stand-alone or as an add-on to any of the sponsorship levels. Items we've done in the past are Badge - Adding logo to attendee badges Contribution Day - Pay for contribution day to happen. Food, venue, costs Social - Pay for and maybe organize an evening social for the event In-Kind - Offer to provide swag items (ads, pens, keychains, etc), subscriptions or extended trials or software licenses for attendees. Be sure to make it clear that if they have an idea for supporting the event that isn't listed in the prospectus, we are willing to work with them, if it's reasonable. Some of the benefits may be limited (such as number of rooms to name, or number a tables that can fit in the venue). This page should be updated as opportunities are confirmed. Organizing Sponsors (CRM) # Once we have a prospectus and have this year's sponsor opportunities on the website, we can start contacting potential sponsors. Over the years we have been cultivating relationships with people and organizations. With so much information we need to keep track of, it's a good idea have some sort of system to keep all our sponsor information organized. During one of the planning meetings we brainstorm potential sponsors and strategy for each one. We facilitate this with our sponsors sheet in Google Drive that we copy from year to year. We have columns for the following information: Sponsor - The name of the sponsor organization Contact - Name and email address of a contact we have within the organization Phone - Optional, but useful information to have if a potential sponsors likes to communicate via phone. Target - Have a goal for what sponsor level or opportunities we think they would be likely to engage at Engaged - Whether or not we have engaged them for the current year Engaged by - The person in our organization who has the best relationship. Each potential sponsor should have one point person. This will usually be the sponsorship coordinator, but can be anyone who has a good relationship with the organization. Sponsored - Whether or not they have sponsored for the current year. That way we don't keep asking them Sponsored Level - The actual level they sponsored at Notes - Helpful notes for when we engage to talk with the sponsor. Eg. previous support level, our perceptions of what their goals and values are Once we start getting sponsors committing to supporting the event, we start a new worksheet or separate spreadsheet to document the state of their sponsorship for the year. This helps us keep track of the commitments of both parties. This can be referenced on a regular basis to make sure the sponsors are providing the information we need to execute their benefits. We have the following columns: Sponsor - name of the sponsor Sponsor Level - The level or benefit they have agreed to purchase Approver - The name and email of the person committing to the sponsorship Accounting Contact - The name and email of the person facilitating the financial transaction Marketing Contact - The name and email of the person responsible for executing the benefits of the sponsorship. This is the person with all the answers for what they want to happen at the event. Room Name - The name they want on the named room benefit. NA if the sponsorship doesn't include the benefit. Table - If they need a table, or declined the benefit of having a table. NA if the sponsorship doesn't include the benefit. Website node - If we have a node on our site for the sponsor so it shows up were we need it to on the website. Done/Not Done Registration Codes - The number of registration codes their sponsorship has been allotted. We often break out registration codes on to a different spreadsheet. Attendees - If we know who will be physically attending the event, we want to know who will be there to welcome them, give them sponsor flags for their badge, show them their sponsor table, and invite them to the Friends of DrupalCorn dinner, etc. Reason - We ask the sponsor why they are supporting DrupalCorn. This helps us understand them better and may give insight on how we can work with them better in the future. Notes - Any other notes that would be useful for executing their benefits or any special benefits negotiated. Having this information recorded and kept up to date makes it easier to remind the sponsor of any information we may still need from them. We want to confirm the benefits they want to use. For example, if a sponsor declines to use a sponsor table, that may free it up for another sponsor to use. Finding Sponsors # Finding sponsors and the people who would be willing to entertain the thought of sponsoring our event can be tricky. It's important to target organizations that would benefit from participating in our event. For example, it is unlikely that Facebook would want to sponsor a camp, so it's probably not worth our time pursuing. Find local organizations that we know use Drupal. Often these organizations are hungry for Drupal talent and have people on staff that will want attend the event for professional development. Framing sponsorship as a low-cost, high quality professional development opportunity can be effective. Other good organizations to reach out to are agencies that use Drupal. They are often looking to recruit talent and flex their leadership in the community to their current and potential clients. Starting the conversation # Once we have the dates and prospectus up, it's time to to get the conversation started. We usually start with an email to the mailing list to announce the camp and ask sponsors to look at the prospectus. See an example of a recent sponsor email . One of the best ways to start a conversation with a potential sponsor is to attend other events where they are participating. Go to DrupalCon, other camps, or meetups. Play the hallway track and talk with people at their booth. Come prepared with paper copies of the prospectus, stickers, and/or business cards with that have your contact information and URL to the sponsor prospectus. While at other Drupal events, it's important to show and promote our brand. Wear DrupalCorn t-shirts and give out stickers and cards to anyone who wants them. Present at other camps and mention your affiliation with DrupalCorn during your introduction. This marketing helps spread word of mouth. With a recognized brand comes a level of trust and legitimacy that makes asking for a sponsorship easier. It also increases the likelihood of a sponsor contacting you out of the blue, which is always a nice surprise when it does happen. Another good way to start the conversation with an organization is to go through a personal connection. If you know an engineer or manager at an organization that uses Drupal, have a conversation with them and ask them who to talk to in order to discuss a sponsorship. Have the person make the introduction so it's not a cold call. Having that referral helps establish a level of trust and familiarity since it was referred internally. While many larger organizations do have sponsorship intake, the competition for those funds and the impersonal nature of those processes make it really difficult to find success. It may be worth filling those out, but do not expect major support other than for in-kind sort of deals like a free subscription to give away or something. Sponsor Communication # Communicating with sponsors is important. Being prompt and relevant with your communications reflects positively on the us. Try to respond to sponsor messages within one business day. Maybe reserve some time every week to review any pending questions that haven't been answered and make sure to follow up. Fridays are not a good day to remind people of things since it is easy to slip attention over the weekend. Commitment # Once you get a commitment to sponsor, it's time to get the ball rolling. Update the sponsor sheet accordingly with the appropriate contact information and agreements/notes/etc. Generate an invoice for the sponsorship in PayPal and export a PDF of it (see Sponsor Payment below). Send an email that outlines the payment instructions and request any information we may need to execute their benefits. Here is an example email: Subject: DrupalCorn Silver Sponsorship Hi {{ Name }}, Thank you for your interested in sponsoring DrupalCorn at the Silver level! Attached is an invoice for the Silver sponsorship. Please let me know if I need to update the billing information. Silver sponsorship comes with the following optional benefits listed below. Please let me know if you wish to opt out of any of these benefits since some of them may be limited quantity. Attendee Tickets - Once registration begins, we will send you 2 100% off discount codes. If you don't want to use all your tickets, please feel free to give them to other people outside your organization. You can work with us to promote the distribution of your unused tickets if you like. Listed on Website - We will recognize your sponsorship by listing your name and logo on the camp website so everyone knows that you are supporting the community and will be at the camp. What we need from you: Payment to by check sent to: DrupalCorn Camp 450 Hwy 1 W #126 Iowa City, IA 52246 or PayPal {{ PayPal Invoice URL }} (We ask for a 3% tip to help cover PayPal fees, if you feel inclined to) Logo file (for print and web), URL, and name as you would like it advertised.

Having the subject clear and consistent makes it easier to look up in email archives, and keeps the messiness of any negotiation cleared up and summarized. You will want to CC any other people in their organization that will be providing this information, and having the full summary makes it easier for them to get up to speed quickly. You may be referred to someone from accounting and another person in charge of marketing. Keeping everybody on the same page is important. You may need to remind people to provide information or ask about payment status. Give them a few days to respond when following up with reminders. Pre-event reminder and verification # About one to two weeks before the event, It's usually a good idea to remind and verify the information and commitments with each sponsor. Doing this now will help save any last-minute headaches if exceptions were not quite aligned, or someone forgot to mention something changing. It's also a good time to invite anyone attending to the Friends of DrupalCorn dinner. Here's an example email: Subject: DrupalCorn Sponsor Information and Welcome Gathering Hi, DrupalCorn Camp starts next week, and I wanted to make sure we have everything ready for you, and that you have the information you need to get the most out of your sponsorship.

Any call-to-action for registration (such as in the a news item, or a page listing trainings) should link to the registration page that the embed widget is displayed. Basic Pages # There are a few generic pages that we normally have on the site. About - General information about DrupalCorn. Example Location(s) - A list of all the venues for the camp. Address, maps, and pictures of all the places. A list of transportation options in the area (public transit, taxi, shuttles, airport information). Example Lodging - Information about the hotel blocks reserved for DrupalCorn along with address, deadlines, parking, WiFi and other basic information. Pictures would be nice too.

A link to this page should also be on every page of the site. Example Sponsor Opportunities - Information for potential sponsors. Explain the demographics of DrupalCorn and describe what sponsor levels or opportunities we offer. This page is important to get published as soon as possible. Example . A basic page could also have a timeslot field so a page can be added to the schedule view. Sponsors # A content type for sponsors so that we can display our sponsorships across the site. Usual fields are the following: Name - Could be the title field. The name of the sponsor Type - Term reference for what type of sponsor they are, eg: Gold, Silver, Platinum, Badge, Party, Sprint, In-Kind, etc. URL - The URL the sponsor would like us to send people to. Description - Could be the body field. About a paragraph about the the sponsor and what they do. Call-to-action, if any. Logo - Image field to hold a high resolution jpg or png of the sponsor's logo. People - If we're ambitious, we could relate users/presenters with sponsors so that their sessions can be featured on their sponsor page. Sponsors are usually listed on a sponsor listing page with just their logo linked to the node, grouped by Type. Example . Platinum sponsors can also be displayed in a block that is displayed on all pages of the site. Sessions # Sessions can be proposed by registered users on the site. This way presenters will have the ability to edit and update their own session nodes as needed. The following are fields that we like to use. Title - Title of the talk. Keep it below 128 characters for YouTube limitations. Presenter(s) - Multivalue entity reference to Users. Short Description - Plaintext short description of the session suitable for a tweet or teaser on the schedule view Full Description - WYSIWYG area (possibly body field) with a full description of the session Track - Term reference Experience Level - Term reference Video - A video field that links the session recording. The following fields we may ask for to help us make decisions and put together a schedule: Timeslot - Term reference, field should not be available to edit by non-admin users. Previously Presented? - Has this presentation been presented at this or other camps? Schedule Preference - Are there any limitations in time that we need to be aware about. Eg. only available on Saturday or Friday morning, etc. Schedule # Timeslot Each \"item\" in the schedule will need a timeslot. This could be a taxonomy vocabulary.

There could also be separate fields for Start Time, End Time, and Day, which may be put together with auto entity label. Schedule View A list of of nodes grouped by timeslot. In order for this view to work, the nodes in the view should have a shared timeslot field. Node types that might show up in this view are Session, or Page (which could be training, lunch, registration, etc.). Nodes that don't have a timeslot can be filtered by excluding nodes where timeslot is NULL. This view could also have exposed filters for things like track/tags, day.
